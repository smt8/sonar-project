\section{Including Figures}

Figures are conveniently included using postscript format.  If you are
generating a figure in a software, please check if the software
supports writing to a postscript or a PDF format. This format is loss
less vector format and with reproduce in any magnification without any
pixelation. Make sure to write it to an ``Encapsulated Post-script''or
.eps format.


\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{profflow}
    \caption[Process flow sheet]{Process flow sheet of the
      experimental setup. The caption of the figure goes here. A
      shorter caption can be written in square brackets to identify it
      in the list of figures.}
    \label{fig:pfs} 
\end{figure}

Figures should be given a label and which can be used to refer to them
in the running text using \verb|\ref{}| command. Figure~\ref{fig:pfs}
describes the process flow sheet of the experimental set up used in
this report. The \Figref{fig:pfs} can also be refered by a short form notation
a pre-defined macro \verb"\Figref".
