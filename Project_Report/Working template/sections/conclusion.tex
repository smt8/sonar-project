\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
We continue to observe that there are several challenges, some unexplainable, in obtaining a stable and accurate reading using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. After we curbed some of the error, we tried to understand what more could've possibly gone wrong with the algorithm/circuitry. This lead us to raise questions at the depth of its internal working, which was a dead end, as we did not have any understanding of the complicated circuitry in it.\vspace{0.8cm} \\
We conclude by stating that the \hcsr{} \ultrasonic{} is a good device for detecting objects, but measurements taken from it can at best be suggestive, but not conclusive of the data about present objects/obstacle.\vspace{0.8cm} \\
We believe that for best results, especially in a robust application, this device must be used for detecting "presence" of objects and so far as to get a fair idea, the data that it provides. But, to measure exact distances of objects lying in front of a sensor, especially if in motion, we must use a different type of sensor, possibly a camera, and even a depth sensor like devices running on Augmented-Reality incorporate. \clearpage
